# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
Sometimes referred to as market segmentation, customer segmentation is a method of analysing a client base and grouping customers into categories or segments which share particular attributes. Key differentials in segmentation include age, gender, education, location, spending patterns and socio-economic group. Customer segmentation is an essential tool in customer relationship management, enabling businesses to market effectively to their customers. Businesses are expected to understand their customers and demonstrate their customer insights by sending only relevant, targeted communications to their customers.

The objective of this analysis is to uncover underlying patterns in the customer base, and to group customers accordingly. In doing so, the marketing team can have a more targeted approach to reach consumers, and the mall can make more informed strategic decisions to increase profits
